                <h2>The Review</h2>
                We were absolutely blessed to happen upon this gem. We were greeted with a friendly smile and sat at the sushi bar. The fish was displayed beautifully and the sushi chef immediately made our selection - crisp white coat and brilliantly sharp knife.
                </p>
                <p>We had the lunch chirachi selection - the fish selected was divine and a really lovely sampling. Miso soup some of the best I've ever had ( I worked in Japan for 2 years)....... The chef was delightful - and then proceeded to make us a dish of Crispy Salmon Skin with cucumber and chili that was his treat for us. This restaurant is truely an unbelievable place.</p>
